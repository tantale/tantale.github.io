# About this blog

I am Laurent LAPORTE, alias Tantale. I am a computer engineer since 1997 (time flies). I am now and for more than 15
years an expert in Python development.

The purpose of this blog is to present some articles about the development of my projects and in particular the
[Deprecated library](https://github.com/tantale/deprecated) project.
